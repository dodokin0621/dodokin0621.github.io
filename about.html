        <div class="d9"> 
        I always focus on  <span class="highlight2">social issues </span>and try to draw attention to these issues through my works. My works <span class="highlight"> may not be solutions, but could be possibilities.</span> My approach is giving my audience the opportunities to focus on these problems, letting them thinking through my speculation and working together to find a better way ingenious. <span class="highlight2"> I try to use my works to make people overcome their prejudices, unify and make them think about justice. </span>My approach is giving my audience the opportunities to focus on these problems,<span class="highlight"> letting them thinking through my speculation and working together to find a better way ingenious.</span> It is not just a way to achieve a potential solution, but more about the conversations happened in between and collaboration process.<br><br>

To attract my audience and let them participate in my works,  <span class="highlight2">I use satire as my design strategy. </span> It is ironic which relieve some burden from the viewer let the viewer experience a dilemma: <span class="highlight">Is it serious or not? Real or not? Weird or not? </span> Thus as a critical design, let my audience make up by their mind. I was influenced by lots of 90s comedy, which used a lot of satires. A skillful use of satire and irony can engage an audience in a more constructive way by appealing to the imagination as well as engaging the intellect. <br><br>

Humor, as my other methodology could help to make an irony, <span class="highlight2">it could use a format to stimulate audiences ideas and sensation, and it could be an excellent way to make the work contain double-take thinking.</span> All of these are the further step for me to approach through my works. Especial most of my topics are serious issues connected to daily life; the humor be used here should <span class="highlight">express more to attack the issue rather than just make it enjoyable for the audience.</span> <br><br>

I am always inspired by unique user behaviors and way of narrative in post-digital age. Since I live in the post-digital age and want to use this special contemporary culture to communicate. <span class="highlight2">I am first introduced to a concept that </span> &nbsp; <span class="highlight">irrelevant ingredients as an age of cultural, social and economic upheavals are driven to a large extent by computational digital technology.</span> <br><br>

Also, the digital in post-digital should not be understood in any technical-scientific or media theoretical sense, but rather in the way the term is broadly used in popular culture. What I am inspired by are this new culture and the ideologies behind it. For instance, most digital-generated contents based on Html and CSS language are more <span class="highlight2">sincere and direct </span>to an audience, since they could be directly used, copied, shared edited by users.<br><br>



        

         Nowadays, graphic design has more possibility,because of the internet work. I have interest on this kind of unreality. I find the <span class="highlight"> connection and contrast between reality and impossibility, which in another way is the future world.</span>&nbsp; <span class="highlight2"> I speculate a future where, the more I will be driven by new strategy,</span> the more I struggle for knowledge and for the recognition of the sacredness of nature.  </div>
