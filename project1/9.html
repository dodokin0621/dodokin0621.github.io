       <p>Wild and fearful in his cavern Hid the naked troglodyte, And the homeless nomad wandered Laying waste the fertile plain.</p>
       <p>Menacing with <span>spear and arrow </span> In the woods the hunter strayed ...</p>
       <p>Woe to all poor wreteches stranded On those cruel and hostile shores! From the peak of high Olympus Came the mother Ceres down, Seeeking in those savage<span> regions Her</span> lost daughter Prosperine. </p>
       <p>But the Goddess <span>found no </span> refuge, Found no kindly welcome there, And no temple bearing witness To the worship of the gods.</p>
       <p>From the fields and from the vineyards <span>Came no fruit</span> to deck the feasts, Only flesh of <span>blood-stained </span>victims Smouldered on the alter-fires, And where'er the grieving goddess Turns her melancholy gaze, <span>Sunk in </span> vilest degradation Man his loathsomeness displays.</p>
       <p>Would he purge his soul from vileness And attain to light and worth, He must turn and cling forever To his ancient Mother Earth.</p>
